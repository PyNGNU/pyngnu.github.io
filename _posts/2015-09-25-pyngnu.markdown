This is the future home of PyNGNU (pronounced ping-g-noo). It's an attempt to
write the Unix command line tools in Python, including POSIX-compatible options,
but also with the freedom to improve on them as we see fit.

This site will grow once we actually have a plan. For now, the project exists
and you're welcome to join.
