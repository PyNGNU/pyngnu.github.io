PyNGNU is a simple project to implement some of the basic Unix tools in Python.
It's mostly a learning project and should not be considered as an attempt to
replace the utilities we rewrite for everyday use.

That said, if you want to use them in the real world, let us know how/why!
We'd love to know if this is actually a valuable thing to the world other than
as a learning experience.
